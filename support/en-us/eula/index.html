Dispute Resolution; Binding Individual Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver</h1></div><div><br></div><div>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. &nbsp;</div><div>BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU AND NINTENDO EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>a.　Please contact us using the method described in Section 19 with any questions or concerns you may have regarding the Application. &nbsp;We can typically solve most concerns to our customer&rsquo;s satisfaction. &nbsp;Any matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement, including its formation, enforceability, performance, or breach (each, a &ldquo;Claim&rdquo;), with the exception of the matters described in Section 17(c) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. &nbsp;The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Claims. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. &nbsp;The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. &nbsp;The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. &nbsp;They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. &nbsp;Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims.</div><div>b.　The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879. To the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees. &nbsp;If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be nonfrivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim is less than $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney&rsquo;s fees in certain cases.</div><div>c.　Section 17(a) does not apply to any Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights) or (ii) that may be brought in small-claims court.</div><div>d. &nbsp;30-Day Right to Opt Out. &nbsp;You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 17 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: CS Admin, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 within 30 days of installing the Application. &nbsp;You must link the Application to your Nintendo Account prior to opting out. &nbsp;Your notice must include your name, contact information and the email address registered to your Nintendo Account. &nbsp;If you send this notice including the information required, then Section 17 will not apply to either party. &nbsp;If you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by this Section 17.</div><div><br></div><div><h1>18. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h1></div><div><br></div><div>The laws of the state of Washington, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws and provisions, governs this Agreement and any dispute of any sort pertaining to this Agreement or the Application that might arise between you and Nintendo.</div><div><br></div><div>If Section 17 is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then for any Claims, the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in King County, Washington, USA.</div><div><br></div><div><h1>19. Contact Information</h1></div><div>If you wish to contact Nintendo concerning the Application, you must fill out and send the inquiry form on the Application or such other method provided by Nintendo.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><h1>ADDITIONAL TERMS</h1></div></div><div><br></div><div>Customers Using OS Smart Devices from Apple, Inc.</div><div><br></div><div>This Article applies to users who use the Application on OS smart devices provided by Apple, Inc. (hereinafter &quot;Apple&quot;). &nbsp;In the event of conflict between this Article and the Agreement, this Article shall apply.</div><div><br></div><div>1.　Nintendo grants a license to you only, for the nonexclusive, nonassignable right to download and use the Application for your personal, noncommercial purposes, according to the terms of the iTunes Store Service User Agreement.</div><div><br></div><div>2.　Apple bears no responsibility for any claims by you or a third party related to your possession or use of the Application, including the following:</div><div>(1) A claim of product liability;</div><div>(2) A claim that the Application does not comply with applicable law and regulations;</div><div>(3) A claim based on any consumer protection act or similar laws and regulations;</div><div>(4) A claim by you or a third party that the Application or the use of the Application by you infringes the intellectual property rights of you or a third party.</div><div><br></div><div>3.　You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no responsibility to provide maintenance or support services for the Application.</div><div><br></div><div>4.　The Application is provided by Nintendo Co., Ltd., headquartered at 11-1 Hokotate-cho, Kamitoba, Minami-ku, Kyoto 601-8501, Japan. &nbsp;Please see Article 19 of this User Agreement for contact information concerning the App.</div><div><br></div><div>5.　You represent and warrant that you do not live in a US export-embargoed country or a country designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the United States government and that you are not on the list of people barred or excluded from the United States.</div><div><br></div><div>6.　You acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple&#39;s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement, and that, by acknowledging the provisions of this Agreement, you acknowledge that Apple has the right (or is deemed to have acknowledged the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as third-party beneficiary.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:right;">End</div>
